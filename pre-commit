# A pre-commit hook for go projects. In addition to the standard
# checks from the sample hook, it builds the project with go build,
# runs the tests (if any), formats the source code with go fmt, and
# finally go vet to make sure only correct and good code is committed.
#
# Take note that the ASCII filename check of the standard hook was
# removed. Go is unicode, and so should be the filenames. Stop using
# obsolete operating systems without proper Unicode support.
